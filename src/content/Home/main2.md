# Corporate

HKN hosts a variety of company-sponsored events such as information sessions, tech talks, and resume reviews. Conducted on campus, these sessions give students a chance to learn more about employers, recent technological advances, and career opportunities. Company representatives are also welcome to join our pre-planned events, including our weekly happy hour, to interact with students in a more relaxed setting. Interested in working with us? Simply click the contact us button above.

# Outreach

HKN hosts outreach events, which are focused on teaching fundamental Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts to the surrounding community through application. Past examples include holding soldering workshops and teaching Boy Scouts circuitry and hosting info sessions about electronics with high school students in the Champaign Public Library. We appreciate any opportunity to give back to the community.
