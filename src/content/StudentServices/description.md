HKN offers many student services, the most popular of which are exam review sessions for nearly every core undergraduate ECE course. Review sessions are led by HKN members who are passionate about the topics they cover. Schedule, slides, recordings, worksheets, and solutions can be found below. 

We're committed to continuously improving our services. If you've recently attended or watched a review session, please consider filling out our [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw3kWh2bGqrUcBFtWbEoZ6nTNc9q5_NAxYruvesSDRuEtkcw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
