Interested in joining HKN? 

To become a fully inducted member of HKN, you must first be invited to initiate. HKN seeks prospective initiates through one of three paths.

1. You have completed your introductory ECE class and are within the top percentage of your cohort based on GPA.
2. You approach the HKN Board with a project proposal that demonstrates technical competence in an ECE-related field. If the board approves, the GPA requirement will be waived and you will be invited to initiate, provided you both meet the requirements for initiation and present your completed project.
3. You demonstrate outstanding commitment to both the ECE community and to excellence within ECE, and the HKN Board directly invites you to initate.

Once invited to initiate, initates will have a semester to show both their commitment to HKN and to the ECE community through the various outreach activities that HKN partakes in. At the end of the semester, initiates who have successfully show that commitment will be inducted as full members into HKN.
